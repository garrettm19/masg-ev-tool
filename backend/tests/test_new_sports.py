"""
Adversarial tests for newly added sports (NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS, EPL, AFL).

Covers:
  - Team name matching: full-name substring strategy works for each sport
  - Partial team name overlap does NOT produce false match
  - Cross-sport ambiguity: teams with similar names in different sports
  - Outcome alignment: YES/NO mapping for team-sport questions
  - Unsupported market types rejected for team sports
  - Sport registry includes all new sports with correct metadata
  - Pricing alignment: correct side gets correct price
