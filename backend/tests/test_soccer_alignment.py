"""
Adversarial tests for soccer side-alignment and generic-token safety.

Covers the root causes of incorrect side labels (FC, CF, City, United)
and the cross-match false positives that produce wrong EV calculations.

Test categories:
  1. Generic suffix tokens don't produce cross-match false positives
  2. Correct matches still work for all soccer name patterns
  3. _identify_yes_player assigns the right team as YES
  4. Same-suffix teams produce SKIP (not wrong BUY)
  5. Full pipeline: correct side gets correct FanDuel probability
  6. Polymarket and Kalshi side alignment
