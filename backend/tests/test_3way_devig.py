"""
Tests for 3-way devigging (soccer markets with draw) and the
corrected edge calculation pipeline.

Covers:
  - devig_3way produces correct probabilities
  - 3-way devigged p_true is lower than 2-way (draw probability absorbed)
  - extract_h2h_features uses 3-way devig when draw_odds present
  - extract_h2h_features uses 2-way devig when draw_odds absent (tennis)
  - Edge is correct for 3-way markets
  - Phantom edge eliminated
