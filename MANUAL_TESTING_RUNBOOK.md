## 1. Starting the backend and frontend

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\activate                    # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate                # macOS/Linux
uvicorn main:app --port 8000              # add --reload for auto-restart on edits
```
Wait until you see `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Probe:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/opportunities/status
# → {"has_snapshot":false,"updated_at":null,...}    (cold start, expected)
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install                               # first time only
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000.

### Both together (Windows convenience)
```cmd
start-dev.bat
```
Two terminals open, backend on :8000, frontend on :3000.

### Required env vars (in `backend/.env`)
```
ODDS_API_KEY        = <your-key>          # the-odds-api.com — required for any scan
GAMMA_API_BASE      = https://gamma-api.polymarket.com
KALSHI_API_KEY      = <your-key>          # optional but recommended
PUSHOVER_USER_KEY   = <your-key>          # optional, only if you ever enable live alerts
PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN  = <your-token>
```
Without `ODDS_API_KEY`, the pipeline fails with 503 because there is no FanDuel truth source.

### Stopping
- Frontend: `Ctrl+C` in the npm terminal.
- Backend: `Ctrl+C` in the uvicorn terminal. On Windows, if uvicorn was background-launched, stop with PowerShell `Stop-Process -Id <pid>` or `taskkill /F /PID <pid>`. Confirm with `netstat -ano | findstr :8000`.

## 2. Running a manual scan

Two paths.

### From the dashboard (preferred)
1. Open http://localhost:3000.
2. Click **Scan** in the toolbar (top-right). The button switches to "Scanning..." and the dashboard polls `/api/opportunities/status` every 2 seconds while waiting.
3. Wait 5–30 seconds depending on cache state.
4. When the snapshot lands, the toolbar status switches to "Updated Xs ago" and the table populates.

### From the API directly
```bash
# Trigger a fresh scan (invalidates the FD odds cache).
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scope":"all"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/opportunities/refresh

# Read the latest snapshot.
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/opportunities/snapshot | python -m json.tool
```

`scope` accepts:
- `"stale"` (default) — only re-fetch sports whose TTL expired. Cheapest.
- `"all"` — invalidate every cached sport, fetch everything fresh. Use sparingly.
- `"<sport_key>"` — invalidate one sport (e.g. `"baseball_mlb"`).

### Snapshot envelope at a glance
```json
{
  "opportunities": [...],          // post-dedup BUY+WATCH only
  "total": 54,
  "status_counts": {               // pre-dedup feature counts
    "BUY": 4, "WATCH": 55, "SKIP": 720
  },
  "quota_remaining": "17502",      // Odds API budget left
  "platforms_fetched": ["polymarket", "kalshi"],
  "markets_dropped_by_type": {     // adapter-side classifier filters
    "outright": 4477, "unknown": 4399, "prop": 962, ...
  },
  "updated_at": 1777590358.94,
  "is_refreshing": false
}
```

---

## 3. Interpreting BUY vs WATCH

Every opportunity is classified by `evaluate_rules` against the centralized policy table in `backend/services/rule_engine.py`.

| Status | Meaning | Reaches dashboard? | Reaches alerts? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BUY** | Every rule passes | Yes | Yes (when alerts enabled) |
| **WATCH** | At least one DOWNGRADE rule failed; no CRITICAL failures | Yes | **No — never** |
| **SKIP** | At least one CRITICAL rule failed | No (filtered out) | No |

### CRITICAL rules (failing one → SKIP)
- `price_range`, `not_live`, `has_bookmaker`
- `name_match`, `outcome_alignment`, `confidence_survival`
- `line_match`, `unit_match`, `side_match` (totals/handicap only)
- `date_not_stale` (per-sport limit; team sports = 12h, tennis/MMA = 72h)
- `price_prob_coherence`, `positive_edge`, `min_true_prob`

### DOWNGRADE rules (failing one → WATCH instead of BUY)
- `confidence_buy`, `edge_threshold`, `fd_confidence`, `edge_plausible`
- `confidence_gap`, `shared_last_name`, `competing_matches`, `last_name_collision`
- `metadata_complete`, `prices_consistent`

**WATCH is not a soft-BUY.** It is the system telling you "I'd flag this if you asked, but at least one safety filter failed." Never act on a WATCH without first understanding the specific reason in `downgrade_reasons`.

Read each opportunity's `rule_evaluations` array (returned by the API and visible in the detail panel) to see exactly which rules passed/failed.

---

## 4. Manual verification checklist before acting on a BUY

A BUY is necessary but not sufficient. Always confirm in this order:

1. **Click `View on Polymarket` / `View on Kalshi`** in the dashboard detail panel. The platform should load the actual market.

2. **Read the platform question text yourself.**
   - Does it match the event in the snapshot (e.g. `Toronto Raptors vs Cleveland Cavaliers`)?
   - Is it really a moneyline / h2h question, not a spread, total, alt-line, futures, or prop?
   - Does the question subject (the YES side) match `side` in the snapshot?

3. **Confirm the date.**
   - The platform market should resolve on the same calendar day (or near-same-day) as the FanDuel event start.
   - For Polymarket, check the event slug — `mlb-ari-nym-2026-04-07` should match the scheduled game.
   - If `date_delta_hours > 12` for an MLB/NBA/NHL/etc. team-sport BUY, the system should already have SKIP'd it. If you see one, that's a regression — file it.

4. **Confirm the price still matches.**
   - Polymarket and Kalshi prices move continuously. The snapshot is at most 15 minutes old (default scan cadence) and may be staler if you haven't refreshed.
   - Click **Scan** to refresh, or check `price_fetched_at` on the opportunity.
   - If the platform price has moved meaningfully (e.g. > 1¢) since the snapshot, the listed edge is wrong.

5. **Check `event_match_confidence` ≥ 0.90.**
   - 1.000 = perfect same-day name + date match.
   - 0.948 = name match perfect, date in 1–7 day window (lenient sports only).
   - Below 0.90 will already be WATCH or SKIP, but always glance at it.

6. **Check `competing_matches`, `confidence_gap`, `has_shared_last_name`, `has_*_collision`.**
   - All should be benign on a BUY (the rules already filter), but the rule trace makes the reasoning auditable.

7. **Check the FanDuel side of the trade.**
   - `fd_odds` and `p_true` are listed in the detail panel. Confirm they are reasonable for the matchup.
   - If `p_true` looks wrong (e.g. an obvious favorite has p_true < 0.5), suspect a side-inversion. The `price_prob_coherence` rule guards against the worst cases but isn't infallible.

8. **Sanity-check the edge size.**
   - 3–8% on liquid sports (NBA/MLB/NHL) is plausible Polymarket inefficiency.
   - 10%+ on a same-day team-sport h2h is suspicious. Verify everything above twice.
   - 15%+ should already be DOWNGRADE'd by `edge_plausible` to WATCH for liquid sports. If a BUY shows >15% edge in MLB or >12% in NBA/NHL, that's a regression — file it.

If any check fails, do not bet. Re-scan, re-verify, and if uncertain, skip.

---

## 5. Red flags ("do not bet")

Stop and **do not place the trade** if any of the following are true:

- The platform's question text describes a different market type (spread/total/prop/futures) than h2h.
- The platform's question subject names the **opposite** team/player from `side`.
- The platform's market date is a different calendar day than the FanDuel event start, *unless* the sport is tennis/MMA where settlement timing legitimately varies.
- The platform price has moved more than ~2¢ since `price_fetched_at`.
- The event has already started (live betting is unsupported and should already be SKIP'd; if you see a live event in BUY, that's a bug).
- The edge looks "too good" — anything ≥ 20% across any sport, anything ≥ 12% on NBA/NHL, anything ≥ 15% on MLB/NFL. The rule engine downgrades these, but if one slips through to BUY status, do not bet — file the regression.
- `match_quality` is "unverified".
- The PM or Kalshi market is illiquid (low volume, wide bid/ask, near-zero recent trades). Liquidity isn't yet a hard rule but is a real risk; check the platform UI before committing.
- `competing_matches > 1` and `confidence_gap < 0.10`. Indicates the matcher saw two close-quality FD events; the rules already DOWNGRADE these to WATCH, but if one reaches BUY by some other path, treat as suspicious.
- Anything in `downgrade_reasons` or `reject_reasons` for a BUY (should be empty by definition; non-empty = bug).
- The dashboard shows "Updated 30m ago" or older. Re-scan first.

---

## 6. Checking data status

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/data-status | python -m json.tool
```

Or visually: the **Data Status** matrix on the dashboard.

What to expect, per sport, per book:
- **FanDuel**: `event_count > 0` for in-season sports. Cache age should be under ~15 minutes after a scan. If FD `event_count = 0`, that sport will produce zero opportunities (no truth source).
- **Polymarket**: only sports Polymarket actually lists. Currently MLB, NBA, NHL, KBO, Tennis, MMA tend to have data; soccer leagues and WNBA usually do not.
- **Kalshi**: `event_count` is the **normalized** count actually entering the pipeline. `raw_count` is what Kalshi's API returned before normalization. A nonzero gap (`raw_count > 0`, `event_count = 0`) for soccer leagues is the **known soccer Kalshi normalization gap** — see section 10.

If a sport you expect data for shows zero across all three books, check:
1. Is that sport in `enabled=True` in `backend/services/sports_config.py`?
2. Is `ODDS_API_KEY` valid and not quota-exhausted? See section 8.
3. For Polymarket, does the relevant `pm_tag` exist? Some sports just don't have Polymarket markets at any given moment.
4. For Kalshi, does `KALSHI_API_KEY` work for the v2 trade-api markets endpoint?

---

## 7. Debugging a suspicious opportunity

The richest source is `GET /api/opportunities/debug`. It runs a fresh pipeline and returns every candidate's full rule trace, including SKIPs.

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8000/api/opportunities/debug" | python -m json.tool > /tmp/debug.json
# Then grep / jq through /tmp/debug.json
```

Useful slices:
```bash
# All features for a specific event
jq '.pass_b_classification.evaluated[] | select(.event | contains("Cleveland"))' /tmp/debug.json

# Status counts pre-dedup
jq '.pass_b_classification.status_counts' /tmp/debug.json

# Stage 1 fetch totals (raw markets per platform, FD events, drops)
jq '.stage_1_fetch' /tmp/debug.json

# All FD event IDs that matched a given player or team
jq '[.pass_b_classification.evaluated[] | select(.event | contains("Tampa Bay"))] | .[] | {event,side,delta:.date_delta_hours,event_id:.matched_event_id,status,reasons:.reject_reasons}' /tmp/debug.json
```

The debug endpoint also returns `policy_table` (every rule's stage/severity/reason_code/description) and `config` (the EngineConfig snapshot used for this run).

For a single opportunity already in the snapshot, the dashboard detail panel shows the rule-by-rule trace.

### Common diagnoses
- "Why is this WATCH?" → look at `downgrade_reasons`. Most common: `EDGE_BELOW_THRESHOLD`, `FD_CONFIDENCE_LOW`, `EDGE_IMPLAUSIBLE`, the four ambiguity rules.
- "Why is this SKIP?" → look at `reject_reasons`. Most common: `NO_EDGE`, `NAME_MISMATCH`, `OUTCOME_NOT_ALIGNED`, `CONFIDENCE_BELOW_SURVIVAL`, `DATE_TOO_FAR`, `PRICE_PROB_DIVERGENCE`, `EVENT_LIVE`.
- "Why is this BUY when I think it shouldn't be?" → check `home_tokens`, `away_tokens`, `name_match_score`, `event_match_confidence`, `date_delta_hours`, `competing_matches`, `confidence_gap`. If everything looks legitimately clean, the system is doing its job and the BUY is the system's best estimate — your job is the section 4 verification before acting.

## 8. Keeping Odds API usage under control

The free The Odds API tier is **500 requests/month**. Every cycle that fetches FanDuel odds spends roughly 1 credit per `(sport_key, market_type)` combination. With 16 enabled sports, a full scope=all scan costs ~16–20 credits.

### Watching the budget
- The snapshot envelope contains `quota_remaining` (response header `X-Odds-Quota-Remaining` echoes the same).
- Dashboard toolbar shows "X API req left" when present.
- `GET /api/monitor/status` includes `odds_poller.polls_today` and `polls_remaining` (daily budget guard).

### Levers
| Want to spend less | What to do |
|---|---|
| Stop fetching a sport you don't bet | `POST /api/scan/config {"sports": {"<sport_key>": {"enabled": false}}}` |
| Increase TTL on a sport | `POST /api/scan/config {"sports": {"<sport_key>": {"odds_ttl_seconds": 1800}}}` (default 900s) |
| Reduce monitor cadence | `POST /api/monitor/config {"refresh_interval_minutes": 30}` (Conservative default) |
| Reduce daily Odds API ceiling | `POST /api/monitor/config {"odds_api_max_polls_per_day": 10}` |
| Avoid manual `scope=all` | Use `scope=stale` (the default) so cached sports are skipped |

### Expected ranges
- **Manual `scope=stale`**: 0 credits if everything is fresh; up to ~16 if all caches expired.
- **Manual `scope=all`**: ~16–20 credits.
- **Monitor on Conservative (30 min)**: ~32 credits/hour worst case = ~770/day at full uptime.
- **Monitor on Standard (15 min)**: ~64 credits/hour = ~1500/day. Will exhaust the free tier quickly. Use only if you have a paid plan.

Inspect cache age via `GET /api/scan/config` — it returns the `odds_cache` dict with per-sport `age_seconds` and quota snapshot.

## 9. Alert status: dry-run only until further validation

**Live phone alerts remain disabled.** All alert testing is done with `dry_run=true`, which routes payloads through `DryRunNotifier` and logs them but never POSTs to Pushover.

### Current state
After the engine v2 + series-game-fix work:
- Backend test suite: 642 passed.
- Real marketplace audit: BUY count dropped from 34 to 4 after the wrong-game fix; remaining BUYs are clean same-day matches.
- Dry-run alert validation: payload format, deep links, BUY-only filter, cooldown, and rate-limit cap all verified.

### How to dry-run
```bash
# 1. Set safe config (Conservative + dry_run before starting)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"preset":"conservative","dry_run":true}' \
  http://localhost:8000/api/monitor/config

# 2. Start (runs an immediate cycle plus future scheduled cycles)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/monitor/start

# 3. Inspect
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/monitor/status   | python -m json.tool
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/monitor/history  | python -m json.tool

# 4. Stop when done
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/monitor/stop
```

Dry-run alerts appear in the uvicorn log as:
```
INFO:services.monitor.notifier:[DRY RUN] Would send: ⚡ +10.7% EV — Cleveland Cavaliers …
INFO:services.monitor.manager:AlertManager cycle: 53 evaluated → 2 passed filters → 2 sent (2 new, 0 re) · 0 cooldown · ...
```

### What must NOT be done until live alerts are explicitly cleared
- Do **not** call `POST /api/monitor/test` — that endpoint **bypasses dry_run** and sends a real Pushover. It exists only for credential validation when going live.
- Do **not** set `dry_run=false` while the monitor is running.
- Do **not** disable the BUY-only filter, the ambiguity-exclusion filter, or the cooldown.
- Do **not** raise `max_alerts_per_hour` above 5 while still in Conservative.

### Path to live alerts (for reference, not yet authorized)
1. ≥ 1 hour of dry-run with a few NEW transitions, looking for false-positive patterns.
2. Manual spot-check on Polymarket of every dry-run-flagged BUY.
3. Switch `dry_run=false` while keeping Conservative preset.
4. Verify the first 1–2 live alerts deliver and that their content matches the dashboard.
5. Only then consider Standard or relaxing thresholds.

---

## 10. Current known limitations

### Player props are disabled
- `EngineConfig.enable_props = False` by default.
- The full prop pipeline (Polymarket prop markets ↔ FanDuel player props) is implemented and tested but gated.
- Two integration tests previously failed on stale fixtures — those have been fixed (commit `2a51faa`), but enabling props still requires a deliberate rollout per CLAUDE.md ("Do not enable props globally without a specific rollout plan").
- Action: do not flip `enable_props=True` for ad-hoc testing. Plan first.

### Soccer Kalshi normalization gap
- The data status matrix shows non-zero `raw_count` but zero `event_count` for Kalshi soccer leagues (EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Serie A, MLS, UCL).
- Kalshi is fetching the markets but the adapter is not emitting `NormalizedMarket` objects for them. Likely cause: 3-way (home/away/draw) detection or subject identification logic in `kalshi.py` not handling some soccer-specific market shape.
- Effect: zero soccer opportunities from Kalshi today. Polymarket also has no soccer markets at the moment, so soccer is effectively dark.
- Status: known issue, not yet triaged. Tracked for future work.

### Polymarket and Kalshi prices move after the snapshot
- Snapshot is a frozen-in-time view. PM and Kalshi orderbooks update continuously.
- The `price_fetched_at` field on each opportunity records when its price was captured.
- Default monitor cadence (Conservative) refreshes every 30 minutes; Standard every 15 minutes.
- The Polymarket WebSocket consumer subscribes to watched market price ticks and triggers debounced re-evaluations on ≥1¢ moves, but there is still a window where the snapshot is stale.
- Action: always re-scan immediately before manually verifying a BUY, and confirm the platform's current price matches the snapshot's `pm_price` before betting.

### Manual verification is required, period
- The system is a discovery tool. It surfaces candidates for human review.
- Every BUY needs the full section 4 checklist before any real-money commitment.
- The system has caught the false-positive classes it knows about (live events, name mismatches, 3-way devig errors, last-name collisions, series-game mismatches, side inversions, implausible edges, ambiguous matches). It cannot catch:
  - Platform-side question-text drift (e.g. a market that *looks* like h2h but resolves on a different criterion).
  - Real-time injuries or news that move FD odds before the next scheduled poll.
  - Polymarket markets whose YES/NO outcomes describe something subtly different from the event title (rare but observed historically).
  - Kalshi orderbook asymmetry where the displayed yes_ask doesn't reflect actual fillable liquidity.
- For these, only your eyes on the platform UI count.

### Other notes
- `routers/odds.py` (`/api/odds/tennis`, `/api/odds/matches`) is legacy tennis-only debug surface. Not used by the dashboard. Recently fixed for a NameError but otherwise dormant.
- The Kalshi WebSocket consumer authenticates with `KALSHI_API_KEY` as the bearer header; if Kalshi rejects the auth (HTTP 401/403), the consumer stops trying. Check `monitor/status` if you expect WS-driven re-evaluation and don't see it.
- `backend/data/alert_state.json` persists alert-state records across restarts. This is intentional (so cooldown survives) but means stale records accumulate over time. The store has a `prune_stale(max_age_hours)` method but it is not currently called automatically.
